# Conway-Game-of-Life
Conway’s Game of Life is a “0 player” computer game. It begins with a matrix where each pixel has one of two values: alive (1) and dead (0). It then updates that matrix iteratively (repeatedly, following the same set of rules) to determine which pixels are now alive and which pixels are now dead. Following a few, very simple rules, Conway’s Game of Life creates a number of interesting, repeatable geometric patterns from seemingly random inputs. To get a good feel for what those patterns are, go to this website: https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/
